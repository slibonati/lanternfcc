stockish is a gpl program that is distributed with lantern both the windows 64 bit and mac.  
full source is available here https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish.
We have appended an l_ to the front of the file names so that when installed from the 
jar to the lantern folder if the user has a copy it will not over write it. Otherwise
we have not modified stockfish.
