Lantern does not link to Mediocre chess in code, but opens it the same as any other engine, as a file 
on the local hard drive to run, once it extracts the engine(engine jar) from the jar(lantern jar) to
the lantern local folder where the lantern jar is placed. 
This is done  when the lantern user for the first time goes to options menu / Analyze with Mediocre chess v0.5.
