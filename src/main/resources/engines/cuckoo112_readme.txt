Lantern does not link to cuckoo chess but opens it like other engines with a runtime.
It's home page is at https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/CuckooChess and says:
"CuckooChess, an advanced free open source chess program under the
 GNU General Public License written in Java by Peter Österlund".
Also if you unzip the cuckoo chess jar, the source is in the src folder.
